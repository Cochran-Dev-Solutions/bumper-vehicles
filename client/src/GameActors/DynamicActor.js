     * Smooth physics interpolation
     * This method can be implemented to handle client-side prediction and interpolation
     * between server updates. It would:
     * 1. Predict the player's position based on current velocity and inputs
     * 2. Interpolate between the last known server position and the predicted position
     * 3. Smoothly correct the position when new server data arrives
     * 
     * This helps reduce perceived lag and makes movement feel more responsive
     * while maintaining server authority over the actual game state.
